    "The leapfrog method is similar to Euler's method as we are once again using *eq 1* to estimate change between points. This method differs from the first as one is applying the gradient for an $u_{k}$ twice to the point $u_{k-1}$ rather than $u_{k}$ directly. The problem this method presents is that one cannot predict $u_{1}$ without knowing $u_{-1}$ (which doesn't exist). A workaround to this problem would be using Euler's Method to approximate $u_{1}$ and then generate $u_{1+k}$ using the leapfrog method."
